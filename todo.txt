is tpm automatically installed...?
if so, should also install plugins
should have logic to check if powerline is installed or not in both .vimrc and .tmux.conf

should separate out aliases and such in .zshrc into a neutral aliases file that
.bashrc and .zhsrc can both grab

should have files check for and source a "local configuration" file, like
.zshrc_local

`tput` in setup scripts does not always exist - termux on android.
